# SCCC (Sane Contributor Code of Conduct)

Code of Conduct is a modern notion and a fetish of nowadays, clearly again a
thing, to over-do certain concepts. Open source was always about doing useful
things for FUN and for doing things WITHOUT causing harm of others in any
way. This was ALWAYS the case, just now, it seems, it's a habit to write a
whole novels on it, maybe to give new jobs for people, writing these madnesses.

This project is like other open source projects: creating something for fun,
meaning an enjoyable hobby for anyone who is interested, without clearly
negative effects, attack/flame/harm people in any way. There is no need to
write on this more, or create "rules" etc. Rules were always there, we know
what are those. An open source project is not a flame forum, for sure.

That's all.

**So in nutshell, the code of conduct: "be nice with the others"**. Sounds quite
logical, even without any "code of conduct", doesn't it.

Now, even I write WAY too much on this very simple and straightforward idea,
which was ALWAYS THE CASE anyway!

Hopefully everybody agrees :)
