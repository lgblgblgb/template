# Contribution Guidelines

"Just do it" - you (and even me!) will see what will happens. :)

OK, seriously, some key points though:

* Clearly, any help is welcome!
* Do not feel offended if your contribution if denied because it's
not suitable for the projects for some LOGICAL (but **not** personal,
because of the contributor herself/himself) reasons.
* Do not feel offended if you are asked to modify things your
contribution to be accepted, even if it's the 32932937297th time on
the very same contribution try of yours :)
