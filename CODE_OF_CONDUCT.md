# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Code of Conduct is a modern notin and a fetish of nowadays, clearly again a
thing to over-do certain concepts. Open source was always about doing useful
things for FUN and for doing things causing harm others. This was ALWAYS the
case, just now, it seems, it's a habit to write whole novels on it, maybe
to give new jobs for people, writing these bullshits :)

Xemu project is like other open source project is about creating something
for fun, meaning an enjoyable hobby for anyone who is interested, without
clearly negative effects. There is no need to write on this more, or create
"rules" etc. Rules were always there, we know what are those. An open
source project is not a flame forum, for sure. That's all.

Hopefully everybody agrees :)
